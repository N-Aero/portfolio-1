# Welcome to my Portfolio!
## This website shows off my portfolio of open source projects

Please feel free to take a look at the code, because this website is also one of my projects! This portfolio is a dynamic, web based, database driven CRUD application, written using Flask and SQLAlchemy. I tried to use many of the popular Flask patterns and extensions, like Blueprints, custom error handling, flash messages, Flask-WTForms and Flask-Login sessions.
Check back soon for a personal tech blog section too!
